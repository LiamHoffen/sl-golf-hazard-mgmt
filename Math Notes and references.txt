Computing point in polygon, use standard code.


Slope intercept of a line

m = Slope = rise/run = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

y = mx + b

After solving slope, plug data for one point and slope into slope intercept formula and solve for b

p1 = (100, 150)
p2 = (85, 120)

m = (120 - 150) / (85 - 100)
  = -30 / -15
  = 2

b = y - mx
b = 150 - 2(100)
b = 150 - 200
b = -50


If ball ends up in hazard area (point in polygon)
using shot position and ball stop position, determine if stop position is within polygon
    if so, find where ball crossed the polygon  
        (test line information with each side of the polygon for intersection)

return zero vector or vector of intersection



Yellow hazard
    1. Stroke and distance - penalty point plus take next shot from location of previous shot
    2. Drop behind the hazard, on a straight line between the hole and where the ball last crossed into the hazard
        In the drop, the ball can roll up to 1 club length either side of that line
    3. Local rule allows for a drop zone


Red Hazard
    1. Use relief from yellow hazard area
    2. Drop ball within 2 club lengths of the point the ball crossed into the penalty area, not closer to the hole

Unplayable ball (inside area ball cannot be played, or in bunker)
    1. Stroke and distance
    2. Drop behind the hazard, on a straight line between the hole and where the ball lies, behind the ball
        In the drop, the ball can roll up to 1 club length either side of that line
    3. Drop ball within 2 club lengths of the ball, not closer to the hole
    4. When applying relief in bunker, the 2 club length or back on line options must remain within bunker
    5. In bunker, can take "back on line" relief to any point outside the bunker, costs 2 penalty strokes


Stroke and distance: take shot from last shot location
Back on line: play on line between ball (or hazard cross point) and the hole
2 Club Length: Drop ball within 2 club lengths of ball pos or hazard crossing point, NOT closer to the hole


Playing from a green into a bunker or water, you can take stroke and distance as relief, leaving you still playing from the green
** shot stroke, penalty stroke and using relief.






Score card should offer options to the player after each shot:
1.  Default: Play the ball as it lies
2.  Stroke and distance: safe zone is legal play area from last shot position
3.  Back on the line: safe zone is 1 club length either side of a line from the ball to the pin, an distance from the pin but no closer
4.  2 Club Length: used for red hazards (and lateral water hazards)
5.  Drop zone (if applied by local rules)

When using and relief, score card should include "walk to" capability to put player on/near the legal playing position
